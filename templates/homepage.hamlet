                <strong>How to log in?
                Gonito uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona">Persona</a> authentication system available in Mozilla Firefox. Other authentication systems are on the way, but for the time being you need to use Firefox.

            <p>So, just click <a href="@{AuthR LoginR}">log in</a>, then "Sign in with Persona" button and Firefox will guide you!
            <p>Unfortunately, Persona will be shut down soon :( Don't worry, just sign in with Persona and then set up a password, so that you could log in even when Persona is closed.
